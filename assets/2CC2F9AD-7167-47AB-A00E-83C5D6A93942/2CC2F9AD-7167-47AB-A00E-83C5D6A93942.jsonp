prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the “ideality” of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.","targetRectangle":{"y":228.68389892578125,"x":467.11083984375,"width":430.00000000000023,"height":251.02537599214702}},{"text":"trRosetta","targetRectangle":{"y":162.86416625976562,"x":120.2918701171875,"width":102.696,"height":28.3038330078125}},{"text":"Protein folding","targetRectangle":{"y":277.01608276367188,"x":137.3737440070779,"width":79.949999999999989,"height":15.622909545898438}},{"text":"MSA Representation","targetRectangle":{"y":572.9658203125,"x":140.90922562081477,"width":115.19299999999998,"height":15.622909545898438}},{"text":"PNAS","targetRectangle":{"y":206.01608276367188,"x":143.04139742438468,"width":33.72199999999998,"height":15.622909545898438}},{"text":"Classification","targetRectangle":{"y":538.19927978515625,"x":258.9329653607092,"width":72.942999999999984,"height":15.622909545898438}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00049229876906403734,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"CE28A0C754290652D2B42D9AB8AEFCBF"}]}]}}]}} )
